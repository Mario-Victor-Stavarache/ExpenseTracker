# ExpenseTracker  

A simple and modern expense tracking app built with **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData**.  
It allows users to log, view, and manage their expenses in a clean and intuitive interface.  
This project was made as a **student project for learning SwiftUI + persistence**, therefore it is a part of my learning path :)
